# A-B testing of an alternative design of the subscription-screen
In this project, we conducted A/B testing for a mobile application to test the impact of an alternative design of the subscription screen on conversion. 
The current version of the screen offered a weekly subscription for $4.99, and 17% of users who saw the screen subscribed.  
The new version also offered a subscription for $4.99, but with a “50% off” label.  
### Test objective  
To test whether the new design will increase the conversion rate on the subscription screen.  
## Data
The input data contains information about 19 997 users and includes the following columns:  
- user_id - unique user identifier  
- timestamp - time of the event  
- test_group - group A (control) or B (test)  
- conversion - the fact of subscription (0/1)
